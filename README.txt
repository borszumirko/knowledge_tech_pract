This system gets input from the user about the body of water where they are trying to fish
and gives fishing method recommendations along with the type of fish that can be caught.
Start main.py and close the frame when the Questionnaire is completed. The system performs forward chaining
based on the user input and the rules in the .xml file. The details of the forward chaining get printed to the terminal.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to talk to our chosen expert yet but he agreed to help us
so the .xml file will be updated with more rules.
